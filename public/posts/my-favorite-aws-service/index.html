But not with the console UI. Send it to CloudTrail Lake. Or send it your log search tool like Splunk.
CloudTrail has saved me so much time and made it possible to answer questions that are otherwise very difficult, like

Quickly understanding how an application uses AWS resources without reading any code. I use it to debug issues almost daily, and I’ve seen it up-level many engineer’s debugging skills.">
