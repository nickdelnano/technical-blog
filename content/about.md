Hi I'm Nick. I'm a software engineer interested in data infrastructure.

I love creating systems that make a difference and providing them as user-friendly platforms. I thrive on collaborating with diverse stakeholders to create impactful change.

When I'm not working with software I'm usually out cycling or enjoying the beautiful nature of Washington state.

Feel free to explore my blog or message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-del-nano-40a545114/).
